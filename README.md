Have you ever forgotten to eat a food item before its expiration date? Throwing away food because it has expired is a practice to avoid if you want to reduce food waste.

This simple app helps you avoid forgetting to consume foods that are about to expire. Using it is simple: just record each food item along with its expiration date and you will always have a table reminding you which foods are going to expire!

## ‚ú® Features

- Display a list of food with their expiration dates in ascending order of time.
- Add, edit and delete items.
